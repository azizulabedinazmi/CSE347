            <p>Hi! I'm Azizul Abedin Azmi, a passionate web developer skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🌐💻</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've always been into taking my photos, cropping them square, putting them through a filter in Photoshop. Photoshop makes things look beautiful just as you have special effects in movies. It's just a part of life. 📸✨</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Photographs open doors into the past, but they also allow a look into the future.” 📷</p>
                <p>“A camera is a tool for learning how to see without a camera.” 📸</p>
                <p>“The more pictures you see, the better you are as a photographer.” 📷</p>
                <p>“What I like about photographs is that they capture a moment that’s gone forever, impossible to reproduce.” 📸</p>
                <p>“Photography is the beauty of life captured.” 📷</p>
